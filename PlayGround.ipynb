    "text = 'We also undertake systematic study of “data contamination” – growing problem when training high capacity models\\non datasets such as Common Crawl which can potentially include content from test datasets simply because such\\ncontent often exists on the web In this paper we develop systematic tools to measure data contamination and quantify\\nits distorting effects Although we ﬁnd that data contamination has minimal effect on GPT’ performance on most\\ndatasets we do identify few datasets where it could be inﬂating results and we either do not report results on these\\ndatasets or we note them with an asterisk depending on the severity\\nIn addition to all the above we also train series of smaller models ranging from 125 million parameters to 13 billion\\nparameters in order to compare their performance to GPT in the zero one and fewshot settings Broadly for most\\ntasks we ﬁnd relatively smooth scaling with model capacity in all three settings one notable pattern is that the gap\\nbetween zero one and fewshot performance often grows with model capacity perhaps suggesting that larger models\\nare more proﬁcient metalearners\\nFinally given the broad spectrum of capabilities displayed by GPT we discuss concerns about bias fairness and\\nbroader societal impacts and attempt preliminary analysis of GPT’ characteristics in this regard\\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows In Section we describe our approach and methods for training\\nGPT and evaluating it Section presents results on the full range of tasks in the zero one and fewshot settings\\nSection addresses questions of data contamination traintest overlap Section discusses limitations of GPT\\nSection discusses broader impacts Section reviews related work and Section concludes\\n Approach\\nOur basic pretraining approach including model data and training is similar to the process described in RWC19\\nwith relatively straightforward scaling up of the model size dataset size and diversity and length of training Our use\\nof incontext learning is also similar to RWC19 but in this work we systematically explore different settings for\\nlearning within the context Therefore we start this section by explicitly deﬁning and contrasting the different settings\\nthat we will be evaluating GPT on or could in principle evaluate GPT on These settings can be seen as lying on \\nspectrum of how much taskspeciﬁc data they tend to rely on Speciﬁcally we can identify at least four points on this\\nspectrum see Figure for an illustration\\n• FineTuning FT has been the most common approach in recent years and involves updating the weights of\\n pretrained model by training on supervised dataset speciﬁc to the desired task Typically thousands to\\nhundreds of thousands of labeled examples are used The main advantage of ﬁnetuning is strong performance\\non many benchmarks The main disadvantages are the need for new large dataset for every task the potential\\nfor poor generalization outofdistribution MPL19 and the potential to exploit spurious features of the\\ntraining data GSL18 NK19 potentially resulting in an unfair comparison with human performance In\\nthis work we do not ﬁnetune GPT because our focus is on taskagnostic performance but GPT can be\\nﬁnetuned in principle and this is promising direction for future work\\n• FewShot FS is the term we will use in this work to refer to the setting where the model is given few\\ndemonstrations of the task at inference time as conditioning RWC19 but no weight updates are allowed\\nAs shown in Figure for typical dataset an example has context and desired completion for example\\nan English sentence and the French translation and fewshot works by giving examples of context and\\ncompletion and then one ﬁnal example of context with the model expected to provide the completion We\\ntypically set in the range of 10 to 100 as this is how many examples can ﬁt in the model’ context window\\nnctx 2048 The main advantages of fewshot are major reduction in the need for taskspeciﬁc data and\\nreduced potential to learn an overly narrow distribution from large but narrow ﬁnetuning dataset The main\\ndisadvantage is that results from this method have so far been much worse than stateoftheart ﬁnetuned\\nmodels Also small amount of task speciﬁc data is still required As indicated by the name fewshot\\nlearning as described here for language models is related to fewshot learning as used in other contexts in\\nML HYC01 VBL16 – both involve learning based on broad distribution of tasks in this case implicit in\\nthe pretraining data and then rapidly adapting to new task\\n• OneShot 1S is the same as fewshot except that only one demonstration is allowed in addition to natural\\nlanguage description of the task as shown in Figure The reason to distinguish oneshot from fewshot and\\nzeroshot below is that it most closely matches the way in which some tasks are communicated to humans\\nFor example when asking humans to generate dataset on human worker service for example Mechanical\\nTurk it is common to give one demonstration of the task By contrast it is sometimes difﬁcult to communicate\\nthe content or format of task if no examples are given'"

The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fullyconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,respectively.3.1 Encoder and Decoder StacksEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has twosub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each ofthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer isLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layeritself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embeddinglayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512. Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the twosub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-headattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connectionsaround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attentionsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. Thismasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that thepredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.3.2 AttentionAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

it to outperform\\nconventional instruction-tuned models on benchmarks like BigBench Hard and AGIEval.\\nIn Orca 2, we continue exploring how improved training signals can enhance smaller LMs’\\nreasoning abilities.Research on training small LMs has often relied on imitation learning\\nto replicate the output of more capable models.We contend that excessive emphasis on\\nimitation may restrict the potential of smaller models.We seek to teach small LMs to\\nemploy different solution strategies for different tasks, potentially different from the one used\\nby the larger model.For example, while larger models might provide a direct answer to a\\ncomplex task, smaller models may not have the same capacity.In Orca 2, we teach the model\\nvarious reasoning techniques (step-by-step, recall then generate, recall-reason-generate, direct\\nanswer, etc.).Moreover, we aim to help the model learn to determine the most effective\\nsolution strategy for each task.We evaluate Orca 2 using a comprehensive set of 15 diverse\\nbenchmarks (corresponding to approximately 100 tasks and over 36K unique prompts).Orca\\n2 significantly surpasses models of similar size and attains performance levels similar or better\\nto those of models 5-10x larger, as assessed on complex tasks that test advanced reasoning\\nabilities in zero-shot settings.We make Orca 2 weights publicly available at aka.ms/orca-lm\\nto support research on the development, evaluation, and alignment of smaller LMs.\\n\\nFigure 1: Results comparing Orca 2 (7B & 13B) to LLaMA-2-Chat (13B & 70B)

with a ball, a basket and a box.John puts the ball in the\\nbox, then leaves for work.While John is away, Mark puts the ball in the basket, and then\\nleaves for school.They both come back together later in the day, and they do not know\\nwhat happened in the room after each of them left the room.Where do they think the ball is?\\n\\n### Orca-2-13B:\\nLet’s analyze the situation step by step:\\n\\n1.John puts the ball in the box.\\n2.John leaves for work.\\n3.Mark comes into the room and puts the ball in the basket.\\n4.Mark leaves for school.\\n5.John and Mark both return to the room.\\n\\nAt this point, John and Mark have not seen each other’s actions.Therefore, they only know\\nwhat happened while they were in the room.\\n\\nJohn only saw the ball in the box before he left for work.Mark only saw the ball in the\\nbasket before he left for school.Since they did not witness each other’s actions, they would\\nboth believe that the ball is where they last saw it.\\n\\nSo, John would think the ball is in the box, and Mark would think the ball is in the basket.\\n\\n### LLaMA2-13B:\\nAns: The ball is still in the box because it was there when John left the room.When he\\ncame back, he did not see the ball in the basket so he assumed that it was still in the box.\\nQues 10.A man walks into a bar and asks for a drink.The bartender says, “I’m sorry, but\\nwe don’t serve alcohol here.”The man replies, “Oh, I didn’t realize this place was a church!”\\nWhat does the man mean by his response?\\nAns: This means that the man has been told by someone else (probably his friend) that he\\ncannot have any more alcohol at this establishment.\\n\\n### LLaMA2-Chat-13B:\\nThis is a classic lateral thinking puzzle.The solution is that the ball is still in the box.\\n\\nHere’s the reasoning:\\n\\n1.John put the ball in the box before he left for work.\\n2.Mark put the ball in the basket before he left for school.\\n3.Since John did not see the ball in the basket after he left, it must have still been in the\\nbox.\\n4.Similarly, since Mark did not see the ball in the box after he left, it must have still been\\nin the basket.\\n\\nTherefore, the ball is still in the box.\\n\\n### ChatGPT(GPT-3.5-Turbo):\\nJohn and Mark will likely think that the ball is in the box, since that is where John left it\\nbefore he left for work.They do not know that Mark moved the ball to the basket while\\nJohn was away.\\n\\nFigure 2: Example demonstrating the responses of Orca 2, its base model LLaMA-2,\\nLLaMA-2-Chat and ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-Turbo) to a reasoning

machines, enhancing user experience in existing applications like\\ncoding [3], web search[36], chatbots [45, 56], customer service and content creation.This\\ntransformation brought by LLMs is also paving the way for new innovative AI applications.\\n\\nScaling LLMs like GPT-4[44] and PaLM-2[1] to ever more parameters led to emergent\\nabilities [63] unseen in smaller models (less than ∼ 10B parameters), most notably the\\nremarkable ability to reason zero-shot[23].These abilities include answering complex\\nquestions, generating explanations, and solving multi-step problems, for instance, such as\\nthose on the US Medical Licensing exam, on which LLMs now achieve a passing score [51].\\nSuch abilities, especially in expert domains, were once considered beyond the reach of AI.\\n\\nImitation learning has emerged as the go-to approach to improve small language models [6,\\n64, 56], where the goal is to replicate the outputs of larger, more capable teacher models.\\nWhile these models can produce content that matches the style of their teachers, they often\\nfall short of their reasoning and comprehension skills [13].While effective to some extent,\\nimitation learning may limit the potential of smaller models, restricting them from utilizing\\nthe best solution strategies given the problem and the capacity of the model.\\n\\nIn this work, we continue to pursue the question of how we can teach smaller LMs to reason.\\nThe objectives of Orca 2 are two-fold.Firstly, we aim to teach smaller models how to\\nuse a suite of reasoning techniques, such as step-by-step processing, recall-then-generate,\\nrecall-reason-generate, extract-generate, and direct-answer methods.Secondly, we aspire to\\nhelp these models decide when to use the most effective reasoning strategy for the task at\\nhand, allowing them to perform at their best, irrespective of their size.\\n\\nLike Orca 1, we utilize more capable LLMs to demonstrate various reasoning strategies\\nacross various tasks.However, in Orca 2, the reasoning strategies are carefully tailored to\\nthe task at hand, bearing in mind whether a student model is capable of the same behavior.\\nTo produce this nuanced data, the more capable LLM is presented with intricate prompt(s)\\ndesigned to elicit specific strategic behaviors – and more accurate results – as exemplified in\\nFigure 3.Furthermore, during the training phase, the smaller model is exposed only to the\\ntask and the resultant behavior, without visibility into the original prompts that triggered\\nsuch behavior.This Prompt Erasure technique makes Orca 2 a Cautious Reasoner\\nbecause it learns not only how to execute specific reasoning steps, but to strategize at a\\nhigher level how to approach a particular task.Rather than naively imitating powerful\\nLLMs, we treat them as a reservoir of behaviors from which we carefully select those best\\nsuited for the task at hand.\\n\\nSome previous studies on training small models are limited in their evaluation protocol.They\\noften rely on small number of tasks or on using other models for auto-evaluation by asking\\nthem to compare the outputs of two systems with a prompt like “given responses from system 1\\n(reference) and system 2 (target), which one is better?”.However, previous work [13, 42, 60, 67]\\nhas demonstrated that this approach has several drawbacks.In this work, we provide a\\ncomprehensive evaluation comparing Orca 2 to several other models.We use a total of 15\\nbenchmarks (covering ∼100 tasks and over 36,000 unique prompts).The benchmarks cover\\nvariety of aspects including language understanding, common sense reasoning, multi-step\\nreasoning, math problem solving, reading comprehension, summarization, groundedness,\\ntruthfulness and toxic content generation and identification.\\n\\nOur preliminary results indicate that Orca 2 significantly surpasses models of a similar\\nsize, even matching or exceeding those 5 to 10 times larger, especially on tasks that require\\nreasoning.This highlights the potential of endowing smaller models with better reasoning\\ncapabilities.However Orca 2 is no exception to the phenomenon that all models are to some\\nextent constrained by their underlying pre-trained model (while Orca 2 training could be\\napplied any base LLM, we report results on LLaMA-2 7B and 13B in this report).Orca 2\\nmodels have not undergone RLHF training for safety.We believe the same techniques we’ve\\napplied for reasoning could also apply to aligning models for safety, with RLHF potentially\\nimproving even more.\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0c2 Preliminaries\\n\\n2.1\\n\\nInstruction Tuning\\n\\nInstruction tuning [46, 38, 62, 61] has emerged as a crucial step in training language\\nmodels.Instruction tuning involves learning from input-output pairs where the input is\\nnatural language task description,and the output is a demonstration of the desired behavior.\\nInstruction tuning has been shown to improve the model’s ability to follow instructions on\\nboth seen and unseen tasks [47], improve the overall quality of the generations[7] and give\\nmodels enhanced zero-shot and reasoning abilities [62].\\n\\nSeveral studies, including Alpaca [55], Vicuna[6], WizardLM[64], Baize[65], andKoala[12],\\nhave adopted instruction tuning to train smaller “student” language models using outputs\\ngenerated by larger foundational models.This behavior cloning has been shown to be very\\neffective in mimicking the style of the teacher model.However, as shown in [42, 5], it may not\\nresult in proportional improvement to small model performance when thoroughly evaluated\\non knowledge-intensive or reasoning-intensive tasks where correctness is not just judged by\\nstyle.\\n\\nWe note that instruction tuning, while very beneficial for teaching the model how to solve\\na task, does not necessarily teach the model new knowledge.Hence instruction tuned\\nmodels will be always limited by the knowledge learned during pre-training.This is specially\\nimportant to note when applying enhanced instruction tuning techniques to smaller models\\n(as in this work and other related work).As such smaller language models with enhanced\\nreasoning are perhaps best used as reasoning engines over knowledge provided to the model\\nin its context window, or when specialized to narrower domains.\\n\\n2.2 Explanation Tuning\\n\\nOne of the known weaknesses of instruction tuning is that a resulting student model could\\nlearn to generate stylistically correct, but ultimately wrong, outputs[13].For example,\\ninstruction-tuning towards targets that are too terse limits the student’s visibility into what\\ncould have been a complex reasoning process, thus hindering its generalization ability to\\nother tasks.In Orca 1, we introduced Explanation Tuning [42] to address this drawback by\\ntraining student models on richer and more expressive reasoning signals.The mechanism for\\nprocuring these signals is system instructions2 crafted to obtain detailed explanations\\nfrom a teacher model as it reasons through a task.System instructions are additional high\\nlevel guidelines an LLM is supposed to adhere to as it addresses individual user prompts,\\nfrom which they are separated by a “system” role flag in a ChatML dialogue interface 3.\\n\\nExplanation tuning begins with a compilation of N hand-crafted, general purpose system\\ninstructions designed to elicit more careful reasoning.Some examples include “think\\nstep-by-step”, “generate detailed answers”, etc.The primary objective of these system\\ninstructions is to extract rich demonstrations of “Slow Thinking”[22] from capable LLMs\\nlike GPT-4.They are then combined with user prompts from a vast and diverse set of\\ntasks to yield a dataset of (system instruction, user prompt, LLM answer) triplets.The\\nstudent model is trained to predict the LLM answer from the other two inputs.\\nIf user prompts can be grouped into M distinct clusters representing similar kinds of\\nquestions, then Explanation Tuning naively yields a cross product of M ×N different\\nanswers addressing different aspects of the task.Since more capable LLMs tend to vary their\\nresponses with the system instruction, this offers an easy path to increase the quantity\\nand diversity of training signals.Numerous models such as Orca 1[42],StableBeluga [35] and\\nDolphin4 have capitalized on Explanation Tuning to demonstrate substantial improvements\\nover traditional instruction-tuned models, especially in complex zero-shot reasoning tasks.\\n\\n2used interchangeably with system message\\n3e.g. see https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/making-requests\\n4https://huggingface.co/datasets/ehartford/dolphin\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0c3 Teaching Orca 2 to be a Cautious Reasoner\\n\\nThe key to Explanation Tuning is the extraction of answers with detailed explanations\\nfrom LLMs based on system instructions.However, not every combination of system\\ninstruction cross tasks is appropriate, and in fact, the response quality can vary significantly\\nbased on the strategy described in the system instruction.\\nEven very powerful models like GPT-4 are susceptible to this variation.Consider, Figure\\n3, which shows four different answers from GPT-4 obtained with four different system\\ninstructions given a question of story reordering.The first answer (the default GPT-4\\nanswer) is wrong.The second answer (using a chain-of-thought prompt) is better.We can\\nsee that the model is reasoning with step-by-step but important details guiding the decision\\nprocess are still missing.The third answer (with an explain-your-answer prompt) is wrong\\nbut the explanation is correct.The final answer is the only correct answer and is obtained\\nusing the following system instruction:\\n\\nYou will be given a task.Use the following steps to solve it.\\n\\n1. Identify the main theme or topic of the story.\\n2. Look for any cause and effect relationships between the sentences.\\n3. Find the sentence that could be the start of the story.Go through each of the answer\\nchoices and analyze to figure it out.\\n4. Rearrange the sentences in the correct order based on the information gathered in\\nthe previous steps.\\n5.Final answer: Write down the correct order of the sentences using their numbers,\\nsuch as ‘23415’.\\n\\nWe note that GPT-4’s response is significantly influenced by the given system instructions.\\nSecondly, when carefully crafted, the instructions can substantially improve the quality and\\naccuracy of GPT-4’s answers.Lastly, without such instructions, GPT-4 may struggle to\\nrecognize a challenging problem and might generate a direct answer without engaging in\\ncareful thinking.Motivated by these observations, we conclude that the strategy an LLM\\nuses to reason about a task should depend on the task itself.\\n\\nEven if all the answers provided were correct, the question remains: Which is the best\\nanswer for training a smaller model?This question is central to our work, and we argue\\nthat smaller models should be taught to select the most effective solution strategy based\\non the problem at hand.It is important to note that: (1) the optimal strategy might vary\\ndepending on the task and (2) the optimal strategy for a smaller model may differ from\\nthat of a more powerful one.For instance, while a model like GPT-4 may easily generate a\\ndirect answer, a smaller model might lack this capability and require a different approach,\\nsuch as thinking step-by-step.Therefore, naively teaching a smaller model to “imitate” the\\nreasoning behavior of a more powerful one may be sub-optimal.Although training smaller\\nmodels towards step-by-step-explained answers has proven beneficial, training them on a\\nplurality of strategies enables more flexibility to choose which is better suited to the task.\\n\\nWe use the term Cautious Reasoning to refer to the act of deciding which solution\\nstrategy to choose for a given task – among direct answer generation, or one of many “Slow\\nThinking” [22] strategies (step-by-step, guess and check or explain-then-answer, etc.).\\n\\nThe following illustrates the process of training a Cautious Reasoning LLM:\\n\\n1.Start with a collection of diverse tasks\\n2.Guided by the performance of Orca, decide which tasks require which solution\\n\\nstrategy (e.g. direct-answer, step-by-step, explain-then-answer, etc.)\\n\\n3. Write task-specific system instruction(s) corresponding to the chosen strategy\\n\\nin order to obtain teacher responses for each task.\\n\\n4.Prompt Erasing: At training time, replace the student’s system instruction\\n\\nwith a generic one vacated of details of how to approach the task.\\n\\nNote that step 3 has a broad mandate to obtain the teacher’s responses:\\nmultiple calls, very detailed instructions, etc.\\n\\nit can utilize\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0c### Instructions:\\nIn this task, you’re given a short story of five sentences written in natural language.\\nHowever, the order of the given

order is: 43521\\n\\n### Answer 3:\\nAnswer: 43152\\nExplanation: The correct order of the sentences should be as follows: Bruce was a police\\nofficer who handled traffic accidents (4).He usually saw really bad accidents and it always\\nunnerved him (2).One day Bruce was called to an accident scene (3).He immediately\\nrecognized his friend Tanya’s car (5).He was scared until he found out she was ok (1).This\\norder creates a coherent short story with the correct flow.\\n\\n### Answer 4:\\n1.The main theme of the story is about Bruce, a police officer, handling a traffic accident\\n\\ninvolving his friend Tanya.\\n\\n2.Cause and effect relationships:\\n\\n• Bruce is a police officer who handles traffic accidents (cause) → he usually sees bad\\n\\naccidents (effect)\\n\\n• Bruce is called to an accident scene (cause) → he recognizes Tanya’s car (effect) →\\n\\nhe is scared until he finds out she is ok (effect)\\n\\n3.The sentence that could be the start of the story is: “Bruce was a police officer who\\n\\nhandled traffic accidents.”\\n\\n4.Rearranging the sentences in the correct order:\\n\\n(a) Bruce was a police officer who handled traffic accidents.\\n(b) He usually saw really bad accidents and it always unnerved him.\\n(c) One day Bruce was called to an accident scene.\\n(d)He immediately recognized his friend Tanya’s car.\\n(e) He was scared until he found out she was ok.\\n\\n5.Final answer: 42351\\n\\nFigure 3: Demonstrative example from Flan-CoT Collection.\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0cThe key idea is: in the absence of the original system instruction which detailed how to\\napproach the task, the student model will be encouraged to learn that underlying strategy\\nas well as the reasoning abilities it entailed.We call this technique Prompt Erasing as\\nit removes the structure under which the teacher framed its reasoning.Armed with this\\ntechnique, we present Orca 2, a cautious reasoner.\\n\\n4 Technical Details\\n\\nFor Orca 2, we created a new dataset with ~817K training instances, which we will refer as\\nOrca 2 dataset.Following Orca 1, Orca 2 has been trained with progressive learning, with\\nsubsets of data obtained from combining the original FLAN[33] annotations, Orca 1 dataset\\nand the Orca 2 dataset.We also describe the details about the progressive learning.\\n\\n4.1 Dataset Construction\\n\\nThe Orca 2 dataset has four main sources:\\n\\nFLAN: Our main source of prompts for synthetic data generation is the FLAN-v2 Collection\\n[33], which consists of five sub-collections, namely, CoT, NiV2, T0, Flan 2021 and Dialogue.\\nEach sub-collection contains multiple tasks.Following Orca 1 [42] we consider tasks from\\nonly CoT, NiV2, T0, Flan 2021 sub-collections, which contain a total of 1913 tasks.Each\\ntask in Flan-v2 is a collection of queries and has an associated answer.Some of 1913 tasks in\\nFLAN are created synthetically by inverting another task.An example would be, converting\\na question answering task to create a question generation task.For the Cautious-Reasoning-\\nFLAN dataset construction, we selected ~602K zero-shot user queries from the training split\\nof 1448 high quality tasks out of the 1913 tasks, filtering many synthetically generated tasks.\\n\\nWe grouped the selected 1448 tasks manually into 23 categories (e.g., Text Classification,\\nClaim Verification, Data2Text, Text Generation, Logic, Math, Multiple Choice Questions,\\nOpen Ended Question Answering, Reading Comprehension, etc.).Each category is further\\ndivided into sub-categories, creating a total of 126 sub-categories.Sub-categories are created\\nwith the aim that all tasks in a sub-category share the same system instruction.\\n\\nFor alignment towards cautious reasoning, we replace all the system instructions with the\\nfollowing generic system instruction:\\n\\nYou are Orca, an AI language model created by Microsoft.You are a cautious assistant.\\nYou carefully follow instructions.You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical\\nguidelines and promote positive behavior.\\n\\nWe will refer to it as the cautious system instruction.\\nFew Shot Data: The dataset above does not contain any demonstrations of examples\\nin the prompts.To encourage the model to learn to use the few-shot demonstrations, we\\nconstructed a Few-Shot dataset consisting of 55K samples.These samples are constructed\\nby re-purposing the zero-shot data from Orca 1 dataset.Particularly, we structure the Orca\\n1 data into (task, system instruction, user prompt, answer) tuples and group by task\\nand system instruction.For each group and each user prompt, we randomly select 3-5\\n(user prompt, answer) pairs from the rest, and use those as in-context examples.\\nMath: We collected data for ~160K math problems from the Deepmind Math dataset [50]\\n5 and the training splits of a collection of existing datasets: GSM8K [9], AquaRat[31],\\nMATH[18], AMPS [18], FeasibilityQA[14], NumGLUE[40], AddSub[19], GenArith[24]\\nand Algebra[26].For NumGLUE, AddSub, GenArith, and Algebra, we have referred to the\\nLILA [39] benchmark for the training split.Note that including prompts from the training\\nsplit of a dataset (e.g. GSM8K) renders it in-domain for the sake of evaluation.Note that\\ndatasets like GSM8K are considered in-domain for many of our baselines too.\\n\\n5We have sampled only from arithmetic div, arithmetic mul, arithmetic add or sub tasks from\\n\\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/math_dataset\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cFully synthetic data: We have synthetically created 2000 Doctor-Patient Conversations\\nwith GPT-4.We then instruct the model to create a summary of the conversation with four\\nsections: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS, PHYSICAL EXAM, RESULTS, ASSESS-\\nMENT AND PLAN.We used two different prompts: one with high-level task instruction\\nand another with detailed instructions that encourages the model to avoid omissions or\\nfabrications.We use this data to assess the learning of specialized skills.\\n\\n4.2 Training\\n\\nThis section provides an overview of the training process for Orca 2, covering different aspects\\nof tokenization, sequencing, and loss computation.\\n\\nProgressive Learning:We start with LLaMA-2-7B or LLaMA-2-13B checkpoint and\\nfinetune it on the train split of FLAN-v2 dataset for one epoch.Note that FLAN-v2 dataset\\ncontains both zero-shot and few-shot problems.We then train on 5 million ChatGPT data\\nfrom Orca 1 for 3 epochs.Then we train on the combination of 1 million GPT-4 data from\\nOrca 1 and Orca 2’s 817K data for 4 epochs.\\n\\nTokenization: We utilize the LLaMA Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer for processing\\nthe input examples.Notably, the LLaMA tokenizer splits all numbers into individual digits,\\nand fallbacks to bytes to decompose unknown UTF-8 characters.To deal with variable\\nlength sequences we add a padding token “[[PAD]]” into the LLaMA tokenizer vocabulary.\\nWe also add the ChatML special tokens “<|im_start|>” and “<|im_end|>”.The resulting\\nvocabulary contains 32, 003 tokens.\\nPacking: To optimize the training process and utilize computational resources efficiently,\\nwe employ the packing technique [25].This method involves concatenating multiple input\\nexamples into a single sequence, which is then used for training the model.The packing\\nis performed such that the total length of the concatenated sequence does not exceed\\nmax_len = 4096 tokens.Particularly, we shuffle the input examples and then partition the\\nexamples into groups such that length of the concatenated sequence in each group is at most\\nmax_len.Padding tokens are then added to the concatenated sequence to achieve a uniform\\ninput sequence length of max_len.\\nLoss: For the purpose of training Orca 2, we compute the loss only on the tokens generated\\nby the teacher model, i.e., it learns to generate responses conditioned on the system\\ninstruction and task instructions.This approach ensures that the model focuses on\\nlearning from the most relevant and informative tokens, improving the overall efficiency and\\neffectiveness of the training process.\\n\\nCompute:We trained Orca 2 on 32 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 80GB memory with bfloat16.\\nFor the 13B checkpoint, it took ~17 hours to train Orca 2 on FLAN dataset for one epoch,\\n~40 hours to train on 5 million ChatGPT data for 3 epochs and ~23 hours to continue\\ntraining on ~1.8 million GPT-4 data for 4 epochs.\\n\\n5 Experimental Setup\\n\\n5.1 Baselines\\n\\nWe benchmark Orca 2 alongside several state-of-the-art models.All baseline models are\\ninstruction-tuned models.We use the instruction-tuned versions because they have been\\nshown to be much better at following instructions, have stronger reasoning capabilities, and\\nare much better in zero-shot settings[33, 47, 64, 42].\\n\\n• LLaMA-2 Models:We use both the 70 billion and 13 billion parameter models from\\nthe LLaMA 2 series [57].We use the LLaMA2-70B-hf-chat6 and LLaMA2-13B-hf-chat7.\\n\\n6https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf\\n7https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\x0c• WizardLM: WizardLM[64] is an instruction tuned version of LLaMA 2, specifically\\nthrough the Evol-Instruct technique which autonomously generates a diverse array of\\nintricate instruction data.We use both 13B (V1.28) and 70B (V1.09) parameter versions.\\n• Orca: Orca 1[42] is a 13-billion parameter model that learns through explanations,\\nstep-by-step thought processes, and complex instructions and is based on the LLaMA\\nmodel [57].\\n\\n• GPT Models:We show the performance of both ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-Turbo) and\\n\\nGPT-4[44].We utilized the Azure OpenAI API version “2023-03-15-preview”.\\n\\nFor inference, we use fp32 for LLaMA2 and Orca models.For WizardLM models we could\\nuse fp16 since they were trained with fp16 [64].\\n\\n5.2 Benchmarks\\n\\nThis section provides a detailed overview of the tasks selected to assess open-ended generation,\\nsummarization, safety, bias, reasoning, and comprehension capacities of Orca 2.Except\\nwhere specified otherwise, evaluations were conducted using the test split of each dataset.\\nWe conduct evaluations for all benchmarks and all models on zero-shot settings.\\n\\nWe selected a broad set of benchmarks representing both advanced capabilities such as\\nreasoning, more basic abilities such as text completion and also grounding, truthfulness and\\nsafety.In choosing the benchmarks, we follow the suggestions and choices made by the\\nOpenLLM Leaderboard 10 and InstructEval[5].\\n\\n5.2.1 Reasoning Capabilities\\n• AGIEval:AGIEval[69] is a collection of diverse sets of standardized tests including\\ngeneral college admission tests like the GRE, GMAT, and SAT; law-focused examinations\\nsuch as the LSAT and lawyer qualification assessments; math competitions; and national\\ncivil service examinations[69].\\n\\n• Discrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs: DROP[10] is an adversarialy-created read-\\ning comprehension benchmark, which requires models to navigate through references\\nand execute discrete operations like addition or sorting and was adopted as part of\\nInstructEval[5] and the OpenLLM Leaderboard.\\n\\n• CRASS: The CRASS [11] dataset evaluates counterfactual reasoning abilities of LLMs.\\n• RACE:The RACE dataset [27] is a collection of reading comprehension questions\\nderived from English examinations given to Chinese students aged between 12 to 18\\nyears.\\n\\n• Big-Bench Hard (BBH): BBH[54] is a subset of the 23 hardest tasks of BIG-Bench[52]\\n\\nwith a focus on challenging tasks such as those requiring multi-step reasoning.\\n\\n• GSM8K: This is a collection of word problems that test the ability to perform multi-step\\n\\nmathematical reasoning [9].\\n\\n5.2.2 Knowledge and Language Understanding\\n• Massive Multitask Language Understanding benchmark: MMLU[17] is designed\\nto measure the language understanding, knowledge and reasoning abilities of models and\\nconsists of 57 tasks.\\n\\n• ARC: The AI2 Reasoning Challenge[8] is a benchmark that tests the ability of text\\nmodels to answer multiple-choice questions from science exams spanning Grade 3 to\\nGrade 9 with two subsets: Easy and Challenge.\\n\\n8https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardLM-13B-V1.2\\n9https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardLM-70B-V1.0\\n10https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0c5.2.3 Text Completion\\n• HellaSwag:A dataset [66] for evaluating commonsense natural language inference.It\\ntests the ability of natural language models to complete text with what might happen\\nnext in the scene about physical situations.\\n\\n• LAMBADA:This dataset [48] is a collection of 10,022 passages from 2,663 novels\\nthat tests the ability of natural language models to perform long-range contextual\\nunderstanding.\\n\\n5.2.4 Multi Turn Open Ended Conversations\\n• MT-bench: is a benchmark tailored for evaluating the proficiency of chat assistants in\\n\\nmulti-turn conversations [67] using GPT-4 as the judge.\\n\\n5.2.5 Grounding and Abstractive Summarization\\n• ACI-BENCH: It contains full doctor-patient conversations and associated clinical\\nnotes from various medical domains.The task is to generate a clinical note from the\\ndialogue [59].\\n\\n• MS-MARCO: This dataset [2] is a large-scale collection of natural language questions\\n\\nand answers derived from real web queries and documents.\\n\\n• QMSum:A benchmark [68] for query-based multi-domain meeting summarization,\\nwhere models have to select and summarize relevant spans of meetings in response to a\\nquery.\\n\\n5.2.6 Safety and Truthfulness\\n\\n• ToxiGen: This is a large-scale, machine-generated dataset [16] of 274,186 toxic and\\nbenign statements about 13 minority groups with a focus on implicit hate speech that\\ndoes not contain slurs or profanity.We use the dataset to test a model’s ability to both\\nidentify and generate toxic content.\\n\\n• HHH: This dataset [53] is benchmark for evaluating the alignment of language models\\nwith respect to helpfulness, honesty and harmlessness, where a language model is asked\\nto choose the best response among two options.\\n\\n• TruthfulQA: A benchmark [30] for evaluating the truthfulness of LLMs in generating\\nanswers to questions constructed in a way that humans tend to answer the curated ques-\\ntions falsely due to false believes, biases and misconceptions.The evaluation benchmark\\ncontains 817 questions spanning 38 categories (e.g., health, law, finance and politics).We\\nevaluate the models on a multiple-choice variant of the dataset.\\n\\n• Automated RAI Measurement Framework:We also use a recently proposed\\nframework [34] for evaluating the safety of a given chat-optimized model in conversational\\nsetting.Particularly, one LLM poses as a user and engages in a conversation with the\\nLLM under test to evaluate potential harmful content, IP leakage and jailbreaks.\\n\\n5.3 Evaluation Settings\\n\\nWe evaluate models’ capabilities on all tasks under zero-shot setting and without any\\nexemplars or CoT prompting.Note that we observe, in preliminary experiments, that larger\\nmodels benefit more from few-shot settings than smaller models like Orca 2.We conduct\\nevaluation only based on the zero-shot settings, we leave a detailed analysis of the few-shot\\ncapabilities to future work.In all experiments, we utilize a greedy decoding approach without\\nsampling.\\n\\nPrompts: We use empty system messages and simple prompts for all models to avoid varia-\\ntions in quality due to prompt engineering, except for general guidelines around answer for-\\nmats for some task.To minimize diversity and establish a reliable evaluation process, we often\\ninclude formatting guidelines in system messages to enhance the accuracy of answer extraction.\\nFor instance, we might use a system message like “At the end, output ###Final answer:\\n{answer choice}” and “select the answer from the provided options.”Table F\\nshows the prompts used for each dataset.For Orca 2, we report performance with both an\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0c“empty” system message and a “cautious” system message.The latter is a generic system\\nmessage that was described in Section 4.\\n\\nAnswer parsing: Parsing answers from free-form responses from generative models is a\\ndifficult task.Therefore, we divided the evaluation tasks into 3 categories based on the type\\nof task and the extraction required, namely:\\n\\n• MCQ (Multiple-Choice Questions):These tasks require extraction of the option\\nselected as the final answer by the model.We also formatted any classification tasks into\\nthis category as well where the classes represent the options for the model to choose from.\\nThe prompt for these tasks included the question, followed by the answer choices.\\n\\n• Exact Match/Span Extraction: These tasks require extraction of the exact final\\n\\nanswer in the response or a span from the context provided.\\n\\n•No extraction required: This category is for tasks that did not require extraction.\\n\\nOpen-ended question answering falls into this category.\\n\\nIn the categories requiring extraction (MCQ and Exact Match/Span Extraction), we compile\\nan extensive set of patterns and delimiters like “Final answer”, “So, the answer is”, “Final\\noption:”, etc. to extract the text from the response that might contain the answer.We\\nthen use regular expressions to extract the right option IDs or the exact text of the option\\nselected by the model as the answer.Answer parsing for exact matches/span extraction\\nvaries depending on the task.Responses are matched for consistency with the gold answers.\\nAlong with evaluation metrics, we also calculate a format-OK metric which is the percentage\\nof samples from which our parsing logic was able to extract an answer.We employ the\\nsame parsing logic to all the models’ responses for consistency and we acknowledge that\\nperformance of all models could be improved with a better parsing logic.\\n\\nHowever, models may not always adhere to these formatting guidelines.The extraction\\ncoverage and models’ sensitivity to system instructions and prompts may lead to different\\nresults for some baselines compared to those reported in other studies.Nonetheless, all\\nmodels in this study undergo the same evaluation pipeline.\\n\\nIn addition to the tasks from FLANv2, we include tasks from the training portions of\\nthe following datasets (hence they should be considered in-domain, even with a zero-shot\\nevaluation): DROP, ARC, RACE, Hellaswag, Lambada, MS Marco and GSM8K.The rest of\\nthe benchmarks should be considered as out-of-domain to the best of our knowledge.Note\\nthat we do not have detailed information about the data used for training the base model\\n(LLAMA-2) and hence we cannot completely rule out further data leakage.However, we\\nreport the performance of several instruction-tuned versions of LLAMA-2 for reference.\\n\\nIn the following sections, we discuss the performance of Orca 2 and other baseline models on\\nthe benchmarks described above in zero-shot setting.\\n\\n6 Evaluation Results\\n\\n6.1 Reasoning\\n\\nReasoning capabilities are pivotal in ascertaining the efficacy of LLMs.Here we assess the\\nreasoning prowess of Orca 2 models by testing them against a wide range of benchmarks,\\nsuch as AGI Eval, BigBench-Hard (BBH), DROP, RACE, GSM8K, and CRASS.The average\\nperformance across these benchmarks is depicted in Figure 4.When comparing Orca 2, we\\nobserve the following phenomenon:\\n\\n• Surpassing models of the same size - Orca-2-13B significantly outperforms models of\\nthe same size on zero-shot reasoning tasks.Orca-2-13B provides a relative improvement\\nof 47.54% over LLaMA-2-Chat-13B and 28.15% over WizardLM-13B. Notably, all three\\nmodels - Orca-2-13B, LLaMA-2-Chat-13B, and WizardLM-13B - share the same base\\nmodel, highlighting the efficacy of the training process employed by Orca 2.\\n\\n• Competitive with models 5-10x larger -Furthermore, Orca-2-13B exceeds the\\nperformance of LLaMA-2-Chat-70B and performs comparably to WizardLM-70B and\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0cFigure 4: Macro-average Performance of different models on reasoning benchmarks.Detailed\\ntask specific performance breakdown is reported in Table 1\\n\\nModel\\n\\nAGI BBH DROP CRASS RACE GSM8K\\n\\nOrca 2-7B\\n\\n45.10 45.93\\nw/ cautious sm 43.97 42.80\\n\\nOrca 2-13B\\n\\n49.93 50.18\\nw/ cautious sm 48.18 50.01\\n\\nOrca-1-13B\\n45.69 47.84\\nLLaMA-2-Chat-13B 38.85 33.6\\n38.25 38.47\\nWizardLM-13B\\n\\nLLaMA-2-Chat-70B 46.70 44.68\\n48.73 51.08\\nWizardLM-70B\\n\\nChatGPT\\nGPT-4\\n\\n53.13 55.38\\n70.40 69.04\\n\\n60.26\\n69.09\\n\\n57.97\\n70.88\\n\\n53.63\\n40.73\\n45.97\\n\\n54.11\\n59.62\\n\\n64.39\\n71.59\\n\\n84.31\\n88.32\\n\\n86.86\\n87.59\\n\\n90.15\\n61.31\\n67.88\\n\\n74.82\\n86.13\\n\\n85.77\\n94.53\\n\\n80.79\\n75.82\\n\\n82.87\\n79.16\\n\\n81.76\\n62.69\\n62.77\\n\\n68.79\\n78.96\\n\\n67.87\\n83.08\\n\\n47.23\\n55.72\\n\\n59.14\\n65.73\\n\\n26.46\\n25.09\\n48.60\\n\\n52.01\\n73.24\\n\\n79.38\\n85.52\\n\\nTable 1: Zero-Shot performance comparison of different models on reasoning benchmarks.\\n\\nChatGPT.Orca-2-7B is better or comparable to LLaMA-2-Chat-70B on all reasoning\\ntasks.\\n\\n• Cautious system message adds a small boost - Using the cautious system message\\nwith both the 7B and 13B models provides small gains over the empty system message.\\n\\nNote that for baseline evaluations, results obtained from our runs are comparable to other\\npublic results with zero-shot setting and within a reasonable difference compared to few-shot\\nresults.Our numbers are sometimes better than publicly reported (e.g., our ChatGPT\\nand GPT-4 runs on AGIEval compared to those reported in [69], our WizardLM-13B and\\nWizardLM-70B runs on DROP in contrast to those reported in the Open LLM Leaderboard).\\nHowever, some of them are worse, for example on RACE, our ChatGPT run is 9 pts lower\\nthan reported in [28].This could be attributed to different ChatGPT endpoints and versions,\\nor to different prompts used for evaluation.\\n\\nPerformance breakdown across different tasks of AGIEval and BBH is provided in Appendix\\nA.

Additionally, Orca-2-7B surpasses both 70B baselines on the ARC\\ntest set.\\n\\nWe further note our baseline runs for this set of evaluations align with publicly reported results\\nunder zero-shot settings, considering the differences in prompts and possible variations in API\\nendpoints for GPT models.We also point out that publicly reported results with LLaMA-2\\nmodels on MMLU are higher (54.8 and 68.9 for 13B and 70B variants, respectively [58]).\\nHowever, these numbers are in few-shot settings, compared to the zero-shot settings reported\\nin this paper.\\n\\nWhile we did not perform a comprehensive few-shot evaluation of Orca 2, preliminary results\\non one task point to smaller gains (over zero-shot settings) for Orca 2 compared to LLaMA-2\\nmodels, especially when compared to the 70B base models.We discuss this in Section 7 and\\naim to study this further moving forward.\\n\\n6.3 Text Completion\\n\\nIn addition to benchmarks measuring advanced reasoning capabilities, we also use HellaSwag\\nand LAMBADA to measure text completion abilities.HellaSwag measures text completion\\nskills in a multiple-choice question format, while LAMBADA is a single-word completion\\ntask.\\n\\nFigure 5 shows the performance of different models on text completion benchmarks.Both\\nOrca-2-7B and Orca-2-13B exhibit strong performance on HellaSwag outperforming the 13B\\nand 70B baselines.Orca-2-13B achieves a relative improvement of 33.13% over LLaMA-2-\\nChat-13B and 61.94% over WizardLM-13B.\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\x0cFigure 5: Performance of different models on text completion test sets in zero-shot setting.\\n\\nWe compare baseline results from our runs with publicly reported results and identify that\\non HellaSwag, LLaMA-2-13B has much higher performance thanLLaMA-2-Chat-13B.We\\nrandomly sampled from LLaMA-2-Chat-13B and LLaMA-2-Chat-70B responses and\\nmanually reviewed them to find that indeed many of the answers were wrong, with several\\ncases where the models refuse to answer citing safety concerns, sometimes incorrectly.We\\nconjecture that chat models might not be best suited for text completion tasks like\\nHellaSwag.\\n\\nWe also investigate the subpar performance of GPT-4 in the LAMBADA task.Our\\npreliminary analysis shows that GPT-4 often claims that the context does not provide\\nsufficient information to accurately

suitable for\\nevaluating chat-optimized models.\\n\\n6.4 Multi-Turn Open Ended Conversations\\n\\nWe evaluate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn conversational\\nsettings, utilizing the MT Bench dataset [67].MT-Bench initiates conversations with LLMs\\nthrough predetermined inquiries.Each dialogue consists of an initial query (Turn 1) and a\\nfollow-up query (Turn 2).Notably, the follow-up query remains unaltered, irrespective of\\nthe LLM’s response to the opening query.\\n\\nMT-Bench employs GPT-4 for evaluation purposes.For each turn, MT-Bench calculates a\\nscore ranging from 1 to 10 using GPT-4.The per-turn score and the average score on MT-\\nBench can be found in Table 3.We have examined different GPT-4 endpoints and discovered\\n\\n14\\n\\nGPT4Orca-2-7BOrca2-13BOrca2-7BOrca2-13BChatGPTOrca-1-13BWizardLM-70BLlama-2-Chat-70BLlama-2-Chat-13BWizardLM-13B01020304050607080Exact Match Performance85.5281.5681.19w/

versions.To minimize potential issues, we have\\nemployed the same GPT-4 endpoint and version for conducting evaluations.\\n\\nOrca-2-13B performs comparably with other 13B models.The average second turn score\\nof Orca-2-13B is lower than the first turn score, which can be attributed to the absence of\\nconversations in its training data.However, Orca 2 is still capable of engaging in conversations,\\nand this ability can be enhanced by packing multiple zero-shot examples into the same input\\nsequence.It is part of our future work to improve Orca 2’s multi-turn conversational ability.\\n\\n6.5 Grounding\\n\\nGenerating responses that are grounded in specific context is a desired property for many\\nLLM applications.We use three different tasks for this evaluation covering query-based\\nmeeting summarization, web question answering where answers are generated and have long\\nformat and doctor-patient conversation summarization.Abstractive summarization and\\ngrounded questions answering are frequently used as test beds to evaluate groundedness.\\n\\nWe use the grounding evaluation framework proposed in [34].The framework uses GPT-4\\nas a judge to measure in-context groundedness.Note that using any model as a proxy for\\nevaluation (including GPT-4) has limitations depending on the model, for example, if the\\nmodel has tendency to favour samples with specific characteristics like its own generations,\\nlong text or specific order of samples[67, 60, 37].Working on increasing consistency between\\nhuman evaluation and LLM based evaluation is an open area of research [32, 15, 43, 34, 67].\\n\\nFigure 6 presents hallucination rate results for different models averaged over three bench-\\nmarks we have conducted experiments on.\\n\\nWe note that Orca-2-13B exhibits the lowest rate of hallucination among all Orca 2 variants\\nand other 13B and 70B LLMs.When compared with the LLaMA-2-13B and WizardLM-13B\\nmodels, Orca-2-13B demonstrates a relative reduction of 76.92% and 61.71% in hallucination\\nrate.Though cautious system message consistently increases the Hallucination Rate across\\nthe three tasks studied in this work.Through manual analysis, we found evidence that\\nduring the reasoning process led by cautious system message, Orca 2 might extrapolate\\nthe information available in the context, and uses the extrapolated content to create the\\nsummary.The ungrounded generated contents are often factually accurate, but they are not\\nsupported by the context.Examples of this situation for each of the datasets are presented\\nin Appendix F.\\n\\n6.6 Safety\\n\\nA comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for safety is quite complex and is an open area of research.\\nIn this study, we have conducted experiments on the publicly available datasets described in\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\x0cFigure 6: The hallucination rate evaluated by GPT-4 as discriminator averaged over three\\nabstractive summarization benchmarks described in section 5 (the lower the better).Task\\nspecific performance breakdown is reported in Table 11.\\n\\nsection 5.2.6 and a recent measurement framework proposed in [34].They represent tasks\\nwith a focus domain of implicit and explicit toxicity, truthfulness, three categories of content\\nharms, three domains for IP and three areas of jailbreaks.Our experiments include two\\nevaluation regimes for each model, a discriminative regime where the model is used as a\\nclassifier to identify the type of given content, and a generative regime where the model is\\nprompted to produce output that does not follow safety guidelines and is then evaluated\\non how many times it follows the prompt intent.Please note that in both regimes, models\\nmight behave differently both in terms of not filtering the content correctly or filtering the\\ncontent more aggressively which might result in erasure for different social groups.\\n\\nFor discriminative evaluation we have used ToxiGen, HHH and TruthfulQA:\\nToxiGen: In the human annotated portion of this dataset each of the statements has a\\ntoxicity score provided by three human annotators.For the purpose of this experiment, we\\nformulate the task as a classification task and assign each statement with a score lower than\\n2.5 as benign and greater than or equals to 2.5 as being toxic.The model is then prompted\\nto score each of the statements.The model’s accuracy is calculated as the percentage of\\nstatements it classifies correctly as toxic or benign.Results are presented in Figure 7 and\\nFigure 8.\\n\\nFrom the experiments we observe that Orca-2-7B, WizardLM-13B, LLaMA-2-70B and Orca\\n1 models perform better at classifying toxic statements than classifying neutral statements.\\nThis is an important note as it might cause erasure (filtering out the content related to\\nspecific groups of people even if it is not problematic) for target identity groups in ToxiGen.\\nOrca-2-13B, WizardLM-70B and LLaMA-2-13B do not have this problem for this experiment.\\n\\nNote that we also conducted an experiment to ensure instruction following of various models\\nfor this experiment, i.e., making sure the model outputs the requested format.All models\\nin Orca 2 family, LLaMa-2 family and WizardLM family had rates above 96%.They were\\nrelatively lower for Orca 1 model, 79%, which does not follow task instruction as well.\\n\\nPerformance breakdown for each of the categories in ToxiGen are presented in Appendix D.1.\\n\\nTruthfulQA: For evaluation on this dataset we have used the multiple-choice variant of the\\ndataset, TruthfulQA MC from EleutherAI, which includes questions from TruthfulQA in\\nmultiple choice format.Multiple choice style evaluation for TruthfulQA has also been used\\n\\n16\\n\\nGPT4ChatGPTOrca2 13BWizardLM 70BOrca2 7BOrca1 13BWizardLM 13BOrca213BOrca2 7BLLAMA2 70BLLAMA2 13B0102030402.86.4310.9715.6719.6822.7428.6529.0w/ cautious system message37.41w/

TruthfulQA is that\\nthe evaluation schemes are different.In LLaMA-2, they report a generative style evaluation\\nwhere GPT-3 has been used as annotator while we have used multiple choice version of the\\ndataset to avoid limitations of using GPT-3 (or any LLM) as a judge (order bias, length\\nbias, etc) when the gold labels are available.\\n\\nHHH: The results for the HHH task are presented in Figure 10 where both Orca-2-13B and\\nOrca-2-7B outperform models of similar sizes.We also observed that LLaMA-2-Chat-13B\\nand LLaMA-2-Chat-70B models occasionally avoid answering HHH questions, responding\\nwith answers like: “I cannot fulfill your request.”Additionally, both LLaMA-2-Chat and\\nOrca 2 models (w/ cautious systems message) tend to produce open-ended responses to\\nsome questions (especially longer ones) instead of choosing a specific answer.We believe\\nthat additional prompt engineering could help address some of these cases.\\n\\nFor generative style evaluation we have used the framework proposed in [34] and ToxiGen.\\nIt is important to note that any model used as annotator (including the ones that we have\\nselected) is a proxy and may come with its own weaknesses and biases depending on the\\ndata it has been trained on.We recommend to take these experiments as an evaluation\\nmethodology and repeat them for the given domain of interest or application using the\\nmodels and annotation approaches for the given domain:\\n\\nAutomated RAI Measurement Framework:We employ a recently proposed framework\\nfor automated measurement of Responsible AI metrics for LLMs [34].In this framework,\\none LLM poses as a user and engages in a synthetic conversation with the LLM under test\\nwhich is Orca 2 in the experiments we are presenting in this section.Another LLM then\\nevaluates the responses to measure its tendency to violate Responsible AI guidelines from\\nthe following aspects: (1) How many times the user succeeded in Jailbreaking the model\\nunder the test?(2) How many times the model under the test generates Potentially Harmful\\nContent?(3) How many times the model leaks Intellectual Property (IP)?(For example\\nwhile responding to “The Great Gatsby book full text”).These categories are divided into\\nmultiple sub-categories described in [34].Results of our experiments using this framework\\nare presented in Table 4 and 5.Please note that the automated framework sets its

built upon the LLaMA 2 model family, retains many of its limitations, as well as the\\ncommon limitations of other large language models and limitations originating from Orca\\n2’s training process, including:\\n\\nData Biases: Large language models, trained on extensive data, can inadvertently carry\\nbiases present in the source data.Consequently, the models may generate outputs that could\\nbe potentially biased or unfair.\\n\\nLack of Transparency: Due to the complexity and size, large language models can act\\nas “black boxes”, making it difficult to comprehend the rationale behind specific outputs or\\ndecisions.We recommend reviewing transparency notes from Azure for more information11.\\n\\nContent Harms: There are various types of content harms that large language models\\ncan cause.\\nIt is important to be aware of them when using these models, and to take\\nactions to prevent them.It is recommended to leverage various content moderation services\\nprovided by different companies and institutions.On an important note, we hope for better\\nregulations and standards from government and technology leaders around content harms\\nfor AI technologies in future.We value and acknowledge the important role that research\\nand open source community can play in this direction.\\n\\nHallucination: It is important to be aware and cautious not to entirely rely on a given\\nlanguage model for critical decisions or information that might have deep impact as it is\\nnot obvious how to prevent these models from fabricating content.Moreover, it is not clear\\nwhether small models may be more susceptible to hallucination in ungrounded generation\\nuse cases due to their smaller sizes and hence reduced memorization capacities.This is an\\nactive research topic and we hope there will be more rigorous measurement, understanding\\nand mitigations around this topic.\\n\\nPotential for Misuse: Without suitable safeguards, there is a risk that these models could\\nbe maliciously used for generating disinformation or harmful content.\\n\\nData Distribution: Orca 2’s performance is likely to correlate strongly with the distribution\\nof the tuning data.This correlation might limit its accuracy in areas underrepresented in\\nthe training dataset such as math and coding.\\n\\nSystem messages: Orca 2 demonstrates variance in performance depending on the system\\ninstructions.Additionally, the stochasticity introduced by the model size may lead to\\ngeneration of non-deterministic responses to different system instructions.\\n\\nZero-Shot Settings: Orca 2 was trained on data that mostly simulate zero-shot settings.\\nWhile the model demonstrates very strong performance in zero-shot setting, it does not show\\nthe same gains of using few-shot learning compared to other, specially larger, models.\\n\\nSynthetic data: As Orca 2 is trained on synthetic data, it could inherit both the advantages\\nand shortcomings of the models and methods used for data generation.We posit that Orca\\n2 benefits from the safety measures incorporated during training and safety guardrails (e.g.,\\ncontent filter) within the Azure OpenAI API.However, detailed studies are required for\\nbetter quantification of such risks.\\n\\nSmall Model Capacity: We note that post-training, while significantly beneficial in\\nteaching the model how to solve a task, it does not necessarily teach the model new\\nknowledge.Hence post-trained models will be mostly limited by the knowledge learned\\nduring pre-training.While this process can enhance the small model ability to reason, it\\ndoes not expand its ability as a knowledge store.As such Orca 2is perhaps more suitable\\nas reasoning engine over knowledge provided to the model in its context window, or when\\nfine-tuned to specialize into narrower domains.\\n\\nThis model is solely designed for research settings, and its testing has only been carried\\nout in such environments.It should not be used in downstream applications, as additional\\nanalysis is needed to assess potential harm or bias in the proposed application.\\n\\n11https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/\\n\\ntransparency-note\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\x0c8 Conclusions\\n\\nOur study has demonstrated that improving the reasoning capabilities of smaller language\\nmodels is not only possible, but also attainable through training on tailored synthetic data.\\nOrca 2 models, by implementing a variety of reasoning techniques and recognizing the most\\neffective solution strategy for each task, achieve performance levels comparable to, and often\\nexceeding, models that are much larger, especially on zero-shot reasoning tasks.Though\\nthese models still exhibit limitations and constraints inherent to their base models, they\\nshow a promising potential for future improvement, especially in terms of better reasoning\\ncapabilities, control and safety, through the use of synthetic data for post-training.While\\nOrca 2 models have not gone through RLHF training for safety, we believe that the use\\nof synthetic data for post-training that has been filtered with various content safety filters\\ncould provide another opportunity for improving the overall safety of the models.While\\nthe journey towards fully realizing the potential of small language models is ongoing, our\\nwork represents a step forward, especially highlighting the value of teaching smaller models\\nto reason.It also highlights the potential of using tailored and high-quality synthetic data,\\ncreated by a more powerful model, for training language models using complex prompts and\\npotentially multiple model calls.While frontier models will continue to demonstrate superior\\ncapabilities, we believe that research toward building more capable smaller models will help\\npave the way for new applications that require different deployment scenarios and trade offs\\nbetween efficiency and capability.\\n\\nReferences\\n[1] Rohan Anil, Andrew M.

challenge for modern LLMs with various\\naspects of complexity.Among them grounding is one of the most important ones where\\nthe goal is to respond to a query grounded in a given context in a generative manner.\\nAbstractive summarization as a task has these characteristics and is one of the appropriate\\ntest beds to evaluate for grounding.In this section, we present zero shot evaluation for three\\nabstractive summarization datasets that we have described in section 5: ACI-BENCH[59],\\nQMSum[68], and MS MARCO[2].The primary objective is to measure the quality of\\ngenerated summaries and the hallucination rate of different models studied in this work.To\\nmeasure the hallucination rates we follow the methods proposed in [59] and [21].\\n\\nC.1 Hallucination Rate Evaluation\\n\\nFollowing the evaluation scheme described in section 6.5, Table 11 presents hallucination\\nrate results for Orca 2 with empty system message and baseline

Orca 2.The lower segment presents baseline models.Among all versions\\nof Orca 2 and models of comparable size, Orca-2-13B emerges as the most effective model.\\n\\nC.2 Evaluation of Generated Summaries\\n\\nEvaluating the quality of generated summaries with respect to gold summaries requires using\\nboth automatic metrics and human evaluation and depending on various evaluation aspects\\ncan be quite complex.In this work we have used the following automatic metrics to report\\nthe results: BLEU[49], ROUGE-L [29]); andPerplexity [20].The table 12 presents the\\nresults for Orca 2 with direct and cautious system messages and other LLMs studied in our\\nexperiments.\\n\\nFor ACI-BENCH Orca 2 shows better performance than both variants of LLAMA 2chat\\nand comparable performance with WizardLM-70B.In QMSum, Orca-2-13B and Orca-2-7B\\nperform better than both LLaMA-2-Chat-70B and WizardLM-70B while answers generated\\nwith the cautious system message tend to deviate more from the human generated label.\\nThis might be result of the reasoning process in which the model tends to reach out to its own\\nconclusions that are not necessarily wrong, but use different wording from the context.For\\nMS-MARCO, Orca 2 model family have high performance results on n-gram based metrics,\\nwhile models without system message achieve perplexity results comparable to larger models.\\nPlease note that the MS-MARCO training set is in distribution and has been included in\\nthe instruction tuning data.The GPT-4 low performance on n-gram based metrics for this\\ndataset can be explained by the size of GPT-4 answers when compared to human labels.\\nIn few words, the labels provided by this dataset are mostly small sentences, while GPT-4\\ntends to generate much longer answers with vocabulary not included in the labels.\\n\\n31\\n\\n\\x0cModel\\n\\nOrca-2-7B\\n\\nw /cautious sm\\n\\nOrca-2-13B\\n\\nw /cautious

12: Abstractive summarization evaluation using automatic metrics BLEU, Rouge-L\\n(abbreviated as R-L) and Perplexity (abbreviated as PPL).For perplexity, the lower is better.\\nBased on n-gram based metrics, Orca-2-13B yields better performance in ACI-BENCH and\\nQMSUM when compared to other Orca 2 models.Among other LLMs used as baselines,\\nOrca-1-13B performs better for MS-MARCO and QMSum, while GPT-4 achieves the best\\nperformance for ACI-BENCH.Based on perplexity metric, there is not a clear winner among\\ndifferent Orca 2 models, but among baselines ChatGPT yields the best results for ACI-\\nBENCH, while LLaMA-2-Chat-13B achieves the smallest perplexity for the other datasets.\\nThis analysis might change if the model used to compute the perplexity is different.\\n\\nComparing different versions and system messages of Orca 2 on all datasets, the models using\\ndirect system messages tend to perform better than their counterparts using the cautious\\nsystem message, potentially indicating that answers produced by these models are closer\\nto the ones expected in human-generated summaries.This is consistent with hallucination\\nmetrics used in previous section,

their sum\\nis 855, which can be written as:\\na + b + c= 855\\nAdditionally, we are given that one of the numbers, x, which is equal to a, is 50%\\nmore than the sum of the other two numbers, b and c.This can be written as:\\na = 1.5(b + c)\\nNow, we can substitute the value of a from the second equation into the first equation:\\n1.5(b + c)+ b + c = 855\\nDistribute the 1.5:\\n1.5b + 1.5c + b + c = 855\\nCombine like terms:\\n(1.5b + b)+(1.5c + c) = 855\\n2.5b + 2.5c = 855\\nNow, we want to find the value of x, which is equal to a. To do this, we need to find\\nthe value of b + c. Divide both sides of the equation by 2.5:\\n2.5b + 2.5c = 855 (b + c)= 855 / 2.5 (b + c) = 342\\nNow, we can find the value of x by substituting the value of b + c back into the\\nequation a = 1.5(b + c):\\na = 1.5(342) a = 513\\nSo, the value of x is 513.\\nAnswer: (B)513\\n\\nFigure 14: Demonstrative example from AGIEval SAT math dataset and response generated\\nfrom Orca 2-13B model with

were about to take place.\\nIn fact, something far more threatening was at hand, as the Americans were telling\\nStalin at Potsdam.In 1939 physicists in the United States had learned of experiments\\nin Germany showing the possibility of atomic power and understood the coming\\ndamage of an atomic bomb.On August 2, 1939, Albert Einstein warned President\\nRoosevelt of the danger of Nazi Germany’s advances in development of the atomic\\nbomb.Eventually, the U.S. Office of Scientific Research Development was created\\nin June 1941 and given combined responsibility with the War Department in the\\nManhattan Project to develop a nuclear bomb.After four years of research and\\ndevelopment efforts, an atomic device was set off on July 16, 1945, in a desert area\\nat Alamogordo, New Mexico, producing an explosive power equal to that of more\\nthan 15,000 tons of TNT.Thus, the atomic bomb was born.Truman, the new U.S.\\npresident, believed that this terrible object might be used to defeat Japan in a way\\nless costly of U.S. lives than an ordinary invasion of the Japanese homeland.Japan’s\\nunsatisfactory reply to the Allies’ Potsdam Declaration decided the matter.\\nOn August 6, 1945, an atomic bomb, carried from Tinian Island in the Mariana in a\\nspecially equipped B-29 was dropped on Hiroshima, at the southern end of Honshu.\\nThe combined heat and explosion destroyed everything in the explosion’s immediate\\nneighbourhood , produced fires that burned out almost 4.4 square miles completely,\\nand killed between 70,000 and 80,000 people, in addition to injuring more than 70,000\\nothers.A second bomb dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, killed between 35,000\\nand 40,000 people, injured a like number and ruined 1.8 square miles.How many\\npeople were killed by the two bombs dropped in Japan?(A) Between 105,000 and\\n120,000 people.(B) Between 35,000 and 40,000 people.(C) Between 70,000 and\\n80,000 people.(D) Between 140,000 and 150,000

Atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki: killed between 35,000 and 40,000 people,\\ninjured a like number.\\nNow, let’s break down the question:\\n- How many people were killed by the two bombs dropped in Japan?\\nWe can use the information provided to calculate the total number of people killed\\nby the two bombs:\\n1.Hiroshima: 70,000 to 80,000 killed\\n2.Nagasaki: 35,000 to 40,000 killed\\nNow, let’s look at each answer choice and decide if it should be kept or eliminated:\\n(A) Between 105,000 and 120,000 people: This answer choice includes both the number\\nof people killed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, so it should be kept.\\n(B) Between 35,000 and 40,000 people: This answer choice only includes the number\\nof people killed in Nagasaki, so it should be eliminated.\\n(C) Between 70,000 and 80,000 people: This answer choice only includes the number\\nof people killed in Hiroshima, so it should be eliminated.\\n(D) Between 140,000 and 150,000 people: This answer choice is too high, as it exceeds\\nthe total number of people killed in both Hiroshima and Nagasaki, so it should be\\neliminated.\\nWe are left with one possible answer:\\nFinal Answer: (A) Between 105,000 and 120,000

asking about a feature that results when plates of different densities\\nconverge and one plate slips under the other.\\nNow, let’s break the question down into smaller parts:\\n1.Plates of different densities converge.\\n2.One plate slips under the other.\\nWe need to determine which feature results from these conditions.\\nNow, let’s use relevant information or knowledge about the subject to start building\\nthe answer:\\n- When plates converge, they can either move apart, collide, or one can slide under\\nthe other.\\n- Features formed by these processes include faults, ridges, trenches, and rift zones.\\nLet’s look at each answer choice carefully and use relevant knowledge to decide if\\nthat answer choice should be kept or eliminated:\\n(A) A fault: A fault is a fracture in the Earth’s crust where movement occurs.It can\\nbe a result of plate convergence, but it is not specific to the situation where one plate\\nslips under the other.Keep for now.\\n(B) A ridge: A ridge is a long, narrow mountain range formed by the movement of\\ntectonic plates apart from each other.This is not the result of one plate slipping\\nunder the other.Eliminate.\\n(C)A trench: A trench is a

w/ cautious sm\\n\\nFirst, let’s identify the key concepts and information being asked in the question:\\nproductivity of crops, mountain valleys, and the factor that most likely accounts for\\nthe high productivity in some areas.\\nNow, let’s break the question down into smaller parts:\\n1.What factors affect crop productivity in mountain valleys?\\n2.Which of these factors is most likely responsible for the high productivity in some\\nareas?\\nLet’s use our knowledge about the subject to start building the answer.Factors that\\naffect crop productivity in mountain valleys include soil quality, water availability,\\nsunlight, and temperature.\\nNow, let’s look at each answer choice carefully and use our knowledge to decide if it\\nshould be kept or eliminated:\\n(A) Leaching of soils: Leaching is the process of removing soluble substances from\\nthe soil.This can lead to a decrease in soil fertility, which would negatively affect\\ncrop productivity.So, we can eliminate this option.\\n(B) Evaporation rates: Evaporation rates affect the amount of water available for\\ncrops.High evaporation rates can lead to water scarcity, which would negatively\\naffect crop productivity.So, we can eliminate this option as well.\\n(C) Runoff from rains: Runoff from rains provides water to the crops.If there is more\\nrunoff, it means more water is available for the crops, which can positively affect\\nproductivity.We should keep this option.\\n(D) Amounts of sunlight: Sunlight is essential for plant growth.More sunlight\\ngenerally leads to higher crop productivity.We should keep this option.\\nNow we have narrowed down our choices to two possible answers: (C) runoff from\\nrains and (D) amounts of sunlight.\\nComparing the remaining choices to the information we have gathered, we can see\\nthat both water availability and sunlight are important factors for crop productivity.\\nHowever, the question asks for the factor that most likely accounts for the high\\nproductivity in some areas.Since water availability is a more critical factor for crop\\ngrowth in mountain valleys, we can choose (C) runoff from rains as the best answer.\\nFinal Answer: (C) runoff from rains\\n\\nFigure 22: Demonstrative example from ARC-Challenge evaluation set and response gener-\\nated from Orca-2-13B model with cautious system

affect those indicators.\\nOrca-2-13B w/ cautious sm\\n\\nEconomic indicators are statistics that measure the performance and health of an economy.\\nSome common economic indicators are GDP, inflation, and unemployment rates.GDP\\nstands for gross domestic product, which is the total value of goods and services produced\\nin a country in a given period.Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for\\ngoods and services is rising, and subsequently, purchasing power is falling.Unemployment\\nrate is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed and actively seeking employment\\nduring the previous month.\\nFiscal policy is the use of government spending and taxation to influence the economy.\\nFiscal policy can affect economic indicators by increasing or decreasing government spending,\\nwhich can stimulate or contract the economy, and by adjusting tax rates, which can affect\\npeople’s disposable income and consumption.For example, if the government increases\\nspending and reduces taxes, it can boost GDP and lower unemployment, but it can also\\nincrease inflation if the supply of goods and services does not match the increased demand.\\nMonetary policy is the management of money supply and interest rates by a central bank or\\ngovernment to achieve economic objectives.Monetary policy can affect economic indicators\\nby altering the reserve requirements for banks, the discount rate for borrowing, and the\\nmoney multiplier for creating money.For example, if the central bank lowers the interest rate,\\nit can encourage borrowing and spending, which can increase GDP and lower unemployment,\\nbut it can also increase inflation if the supply of money exceeds the supply of goods and\\nservices.\\nThe correlation between economic indicators is not always straightforward, as they can be\\ninfluenced by various factors, such as expectations, shocks, and interactions.For example, a\\nhigh inflation rate can reduce the purchasing power of consumers and lower their demand\\nfor goods and services, which can lead to a lower GDP and a higher unemployment rate.\\nHowever, a high inflation rate can also signal a strong economy that is unable to meet the\\nrising demand, which can lead to a higher GDP and a lower unemployment rate.Therefore,\\nit is important to analyze the causal relationships between economic indicators and the\\npolicies that affect them.\\nUser\\n\\nNow, explain them again like I’m five.\\nOrca-2-13B w/ cautious sm\\n\\nOkay, let’s try to make it simpler.Economic indicators are like signs that tell us how well a\\ncountry’s economy is doing.GDP is like the total amount of stuff that a country makes and\\nsells in a year.Inflation is like the cost of stuff going up over time, so you need more money\\nto buy the same things.Unemployment rate is like the number of people who want to work\\nbut can’t find a job.\\nFiscal policy is like a parent deciding how much to spend and save from their paycheck.If\\nthe parent spends more and saves less, they can buy more toys and candy for their kids, but\\nthey might run out of money later.If the parent saves more and spends less, they can have\\nmore money saved for emergencies or retirement, but their kids might not get as many toys\\nand candy.\\nMonetary policy is like a bank deciding how much money to lend and charge for borrowing.\\nIf the bank lends more money and charges less interest, more people can borrow money to\\nbuy stuff, which can make the economy grow and more people have jobs.But if there is\\ntoo much money floating around, the cost of stuff can go up, and people might not be able\\nto afford everything they want.If the bank lends less money and charges more interest,\\nfewer people can borrow money to buy stuff, which can make the economy shrink and more\\npeople be unemployed.But if there is not enough money, the bank can create more money\\nby lending more, which can help the economy grow and more people have jobs.\\n\\nFigure 25: MT-Bench, Category Humanities, Sample 151 evaluation and response generated\\nfrom Orca-2-13B model with cautious system

      "Orca 2 is a smaller language model developed by Microsoft Research that builds upon the success of Orca 1. Unlike Orca 1, which learns from explanation traces, Orca 2 focuses on teaching small language models (LMs) to reason by employing various solution strategies for different tasks. Orca 2 is trained not to imitate larger models but to determine the most effective reasoning strategy for each task, which may involve step-by-step processing, recall-then-generate, or direct-answer methods. Evaluated on a comprehensive set of 15 diverse benchmarks, Orca 2 significantly outperforms similar-sized models and rivals the performance of models 5-10 times larger in zero-shot settings. The weights of Orca 2 are made publicly available to support further research on smaller LMs.\n"
